I had a lot of trouble setting up the local Linux environment because my Mac was not compatible with VirtualBox and the different solutions I tried didn't work. Due to trying to solve this initial problem, I did not leave enough time to understand the set-up for the server using the Debian virtual machine, As a result, I was unable to push my config files to Github.
